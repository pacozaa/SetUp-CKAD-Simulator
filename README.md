This repo use for preparing ckad exam 2022

After I try out killer.sh from linux training portal, I would like to go over it on local with the same set up as much as possible. If you tried out killer.sh before this repo will make sense. 

I would recommend you checkout official document first and look into this repo because there are some pre-install command you can use.

config file is the file you should practice typing over and over again to get used to preparing before exam because right now the exam is on simulator not your own machine. Just do it everyday before the exam you will get used to it.

Definitly checkout this repo as well https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises/
